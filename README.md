Leo training course V1

This is my free map for a Leo training course V1. 
It's basically the base for me to custom-make my first full map, but it works well. I'm releasing it for free. 

[[  I do not provide the script in the video  ]]

you can get this from PhoenixStudios = [[source](https://forum.cfx.re/t/free-police-training-map-script/5170801)]. 
and the police tools in the video from PickleMods =  [[source](https://forum.cfx.re/t/pickles-police-tools-shields-snakecam-bodycam-panic-button-and-more/4978950)]. 

I highly recommend them i will be adding a readme with instructions on where to add the NPC parts and script. 
I have made 42 scripts. I will be updating the map until I start making the custom build. 

Thank you for downloading and using it.

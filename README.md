Leo training course V1

This is my free map for a Leo training course V1. It’s basically the base for me to custom-make my first full map, but it works well. I’m releasing it for free.

[[ I do not provide the script in the video ]]

you can get this free from PhoenixStudios = ([Free] Police Training [Map + Script])](https://forum.cfx.re/t/free-police-training-map-script/5170801).
and the police tools in the video paid from PickleMods = (Pickle's Police Tools | Shields, Snakecam, Bodycam, Panic Button, and more!)](https://forum.cfx.re/t/pickles-police-tools-shields-snakecam-bodycam-panic-button-and-more/4978950).

i will be adding a readme with instructions on where to add the NPC parts to the script. I have made 42 npc . I will be updating the map until I start making the custom build.

Thank you for downloading and using it.
